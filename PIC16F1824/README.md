uChip - PIC16F1824
==================

2014-Nov-20
The folders were put on incremental order so the learning curve is smooth. Some paths are not ready yet, but still appear in the list below:   

1-registers-and-ports  
2-binary-in-binary-out  
3-analog-in-binary-out  
4-PWM-module  
5-SPI-protocol  
6-serial-EUSART-protocol  
7-ADC-serial-EUSART  

##### USAGE NOTES:
